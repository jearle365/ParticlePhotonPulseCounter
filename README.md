# ParticlePhotonPulseCounter

This is a pulse counter made on the particle photon which senses a pulse on pin D5 and counts it. This information is then published as a json webhook to the particle cloud. I have the particle cloud webhook set up to transfer the data to my shared hosting website's MySQL database. I am posting this here just in case any pieces may help someone else trying to do the same thing. 

## Getting Started
You can use the particle webIDE to flash this software to your photon

### Attributes
This would not have been possible without the help of @Rftop on the particle community forums who helped me through the whole process of troubleshooting and rewrote my base for me. I really appreciate all the help.
